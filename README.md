# T.I.M = time is money 

### A social media app, in which members can offer various services, each one according to their knowledge, experience and will. For example, private lessons, pet care, alternative medicine etc. Each TIM member who provides a service to another member, gets points (coins) for that service, and with these coins they can pay for a service from another member.
